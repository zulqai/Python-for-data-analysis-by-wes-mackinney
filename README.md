Notebook based on the book: 'Python for data analysis' 


My honest about about this book.

I recently comleted 'Python for Data Analysis' by Wes McKinney (~500+ pages)

I highly recommend this book to you if you're new to numpy and pandas and want to jump into machine learning & AI.

It explores a wide range of powerful topics — from data cleaning and wrangling to visualization, aggregation, time series analysis, and so much more — so you can unlock insights from data.

The only prerequisite you need is basic understanding of python (loop, functions, etc)

You can also download my notebook — it includes over 2,500 executed cells based on the book's exercises.

I am on a journey like you to become ML/AI Engineer. Lets connect and learn together.

Next I am planning to read 'Hands on Machine Learning with Scikit-learn' to build some cool projects.
